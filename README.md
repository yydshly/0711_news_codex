# News Codex

Audited source intelligence registry for AI and developer news. Phase one validates, probes,
versions, and reports on sources before downstream summarization is enabled.

## Requirements

- Python 3.12+
- `uv`
- PostgreSQL 14+
- No Docker is required or used

## Local setup

```powershell
uv sync --extra dev
Copy-Item .env.example .env
# Edit DATABASE_URL in .env for your local PostgreSQL role/database.
uv run alembic upgrade head
```

Never put an API key in `sources/*.yaml`. Credentials are read from environment variables only.

## Source workflow

```powershell
uv run newsradar sources validate --root sources
uv run newsradar sources sync --root sources
uv run newsradar sources probe --all --root sources
uv run newsradar sources probe hackernews-top --root sources --no-persist
uv run newsradar sources report --root sources --output reports/source-intelligence.md
```

When database credentials are not configured, use `--no-persist`. A live report can still be
created from the network run:

```powershell
uv run newsradar sources probe --all --root sources --no-persist `
  --report-output reports/live-source-intelligence.md
```

YAML is the audited source of truth. Probe history and immutable YAML versions belong in
PostgreSQL. Probe results never rewrite YAML or automatically activate a source.

## MiniMax

The constrained adapter supports:

- `MiniMax-M2.7-highspeed` for source classification and topic inference
- `MiniMax-M3` for explaining probe failures and future event-level synthesis

MiniMax is optional in phase one. Without `MINIMAX_API_KEY`, deterministic rules remain usable.
All source content is marked as untrusted, tool use is disabled, responses are validated with
Pydantic, and invalid JSON gets at most one repair attempt.

## Quality gates

```powershell
uv run ruff check .
uv run pytest
```

The current catalog contains first-party RSS feeds, GitHub releases, Hacker News, arXiv,
conditional Reddit sources, and discovery-only aggregators. X and high-risk Chinese social
scraping are intentionally outside phase one.
